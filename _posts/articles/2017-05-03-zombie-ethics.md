## Zombie Ethics: How will Human morality react to the Zombie Apocalypse?
 
**Introduction** 
Philosophers have argued for centuries whether or not humans are born inherently good or evil. “If we are born with a good nature, then it is society that corrupts us, and if we are born with a bad nature, society is what keeps our desire to commit evil at bay.” (1) No matter which side of the argument you defend, it is an undisputable fact that when faced with apocalypse and the dissolution of society, actions once considered drastic become the norm as humans struggle to survive. This reversal of moral codes is explored well within the zombie genre. Flesh eating monsters are an ever present threat within zombie media, but perhaps the greatest challenges are the repugnant choices humans are faced with - choices such as  murder, theft, cannibalism, and many more sacrifices of morality. With the rise of zombies in our popular culture within the last few decades, there have been increasingly realistic and profound depictions of the world reacting to a zombie apocalypse. We center upon examples of these depictions here, through critical discourse analysis of select scenes from The Walking Dead, The Zombie Survival Guide, and World War Z. As a result of our analysis, we make predictions as to how humans will fare in the apocalypse. This is significant because our exploration of the landscape of zombie media  illustrates not only the nature of humankind, but also the contemporary issues of racism and classism  issues that we face today, specifically in the U.S.
 
**Racism**

“_Shoot first, ask questions about morality  later._”
Structural racism is the combined results of institutionalized practice and learn behavior. 

For the sake of this essay, racism will be defined as “the normalization and legitimization of an array of dynamics – historical, cultural, institutional and interpersonal – that routinely advantage Whites while producing cumulative and chronic adverse outcomes for people of color”.(2)  
One example of structural racism is the inordinate amount of unarmed black men being murdered by police throughout the United States. This can be credited to the negative stereotypes associated with black males. 
“For example, Black men are more likely than White men to be misremembered as carrying a weapon (Allport & Postman, 1947), are more likely to facilitate the visual recognition of a weapon (Payne, 2001), are more likely to be shot mistakenly in a virtual crime scenario while holding an innocent object such as a soda can (Correll et al., 2002; Correll, Wittenbrink, Park, Judd, & Goyle, 2011; cf. James, Vila, & Daratha, 2013), and are more likely to activate concepts related to crime (Eberhardt, Goff, Purdie, & Davies, 2004).”(Wilson, 2017)
This article gives insight into how police justify the murder of Black males given their perceived that they are larger and more formidable than their White counterparts, which justifies more force exerted when subduing them. Given how racist practices like this surface everyday in American society, we predict racism will continue to surface in post apocalyptic settings after the collapse of a society. Although society in America has not yet collapsed, accurate predictions of human behavior can be drawn from previous cases in history where American society was on the brink of collapse. For example, both World Wars I and II were considered to be a “total war”, or a war that required the combined efforts of the entire population and resources of the entire country to win. This meant that people of color, women, and people of all gender identities were involved in the wartime effort. These two wars were the closest America has come to collapsing, and despite this, minorities were viciously oppressed during and after both World Wars.
 “During the war, the Marines excluded blacks, the Navy used them as servants, and the Army created separate black regiments commanded mostly by white officers. The Red Cross even segregated blood plasma.” (Social Changes During the War, Digital History)
Morality was at an extreme low and human rights continued to be violated  during the two most deadly wars in American history, so the idea that human nature would become altruistic  during an apocalypse is highly improbable.  In fact, without the laws in place today that guarantee inalienable human rights, America’s moral compass could only become worse. 

Dale and T-Dawg in TWD
 The Walking Dead follows sheriff's deputy Rick Grimes, who awakens from a coma discovering a world overrun by zombies, commonly referred to as "walkers". Grimes reunites with his family and becomes the leader of a group he forms with other survivors. Together they struggle to survive and adapt in a post-apocalyptic world filled with walkers and opposing groups of survivors, who are often more dangerous than the walkers themselves.
In season 2, episode 1 (2011) of The Walking Dead, T Dawg expresses fear for his life not only as a human attempting to survive the zombie apocalypse, but also as a Black man trying to survive in Atlanta, Georgia. T Dawg is not making these claims without reason, as he was called the n-word and was assaulted by Meryl, a bigoted White Southern Male. This scene is particularly powerful because as it allows viewers to experience what race relations outside of a structured society would be like. Dale, a middle age white male, refuses to acknowledge T Dawg’s concerns due to his race, and defends Meryl without even acknowledging his racist remarks. The refusal to acknowledge problematic power structures has continued for centuries, and I believe this attitude will be prevalent amongst people during an apocalypse as well.
**Ethics in Human and Zombie History**
        	The Zombie Survival Guide, published in 2003, is a fictional but comprehensive guide to surviving in a zombie infested world. It presents alternative history set in the real world. The author Max Brooks describes prevailing attitudes that Europeans had during the Age of Colonialism. Jean Beart Lacoutour, a French businessman, describes in a letter how the French colonists would force the residents of Indochina (or modern Vietnam) to fight in a cage with zombies for the entertainment of the French. 
“A living human is placed in a cage with one of these creatures. Our human has with him only a small blade, perhaps eight centimeters at most… Will he survive his waltz with the living corpse? If so, how long will he last?”(Brooks , The Zombie Survival Guide)  
The French had no regard for the safety of their colonists, as they would treat a matter of their life and death as entertainment, a sport to watch. The colonists notoriously committed dozens of human rights violations towards the people they exploited, and this excerpt demonstrates that racism or cultural superiority of cruel nature can still persist during a situation as grave as a zombie apocalypse. One of the original questions that this exploration is considering is whether we are good or bad by nature, and how society influences that. We have argued that our moral compass will spin south after the apocalypse with the use of the Redeker Plan etc, but historic incidents such as these may suggest that we never showed much regard for human life in the first place. Perhaps in the case of the zombie apocalypse, the dissolution of society will take away the social pressure that governs morality and leave humans free to make selfish or ‘unethical’ decisions. 
 
**Cannibalism**
Cannibalism has been present throughout human history, but it has long since been declared taboo, and laws are in place that deter anyone from attempting to cannibalize their fellow human. However, it is only during times of peace and societal stability that cannibalism is frowned upon. The only exception to this is the custom of the sea, which states that when shipwrecked, survivors are legally able to draw lots to see who will be cannibalized to ensure the survival of the others. During an apocalypse, however ,  the global stance on cannibalism drastically changes, as  cannibalism becomes necessary for people to survive prolonged periods of food shortages. In World War Z, cannibalism was essential to the survival of one particular family unit.  Jesika, the protagonist of this particular chapter, describes to the narrator how her family became cannibals in order to fend off starvation. At first, when the situation seemed like it would get better, Jesika describes the situation as one giant camping trip. “We all sang around the campfires at night, these giant bonfires of logs stacked up on one another.”  However, once they ran out of food, people turned on one another fairly quickly, and the situation became dire.  The decision to eat people was a difficult choice for Jesika’s parents, they debated viciously the night they first tried human flesh. However, as they valued their survival over their morals, they ultimately gave in. “No more fights, no more shooting. By Christmas Day there was plenty of food.” When first reading this chapter, I thought of it as no more than another interesting tale. However, upon further investigation, this chapter is almost like a social experiment, as it explores what life would be like if we were to remove societal norms and restrictions to our behavior.

**Redeker Plan**
The Redeker Plan is a long-term survival plan masterminded by Paul Redeker, a character in Max Brooks’ novel World War Z. It originated from Plan Orange Eighty-Four, which was a plan to save the white minority in South Africa in case the African majorities rebelled. A cold and widely criticized plan, the Redeker Plan features the intentional sacrifice of a significant part of the population so that a “chosen” lot of people can survive in a secluded safe zone. It even features the government replenishing the sacrificial colonies with more people to keep the zombie distracted continuously. As it stemmed from the salvation of a racist minority, it is no surprise that the Redeker Plan was designed to only save a small population of “chosen “individuals”. 
“Those who were left behind were to be herded into special isolated zones. They were to be "human bait," distracting the undead from following the retreating army to their safe zone. Redeker argued that these isolated, uninfected refugees must be kept alive, well defended and even resupplied, if possible, so as to keep the undead hordes firmly rooted to the spot. ” (Brooks, World War Z). 
Although the Redeker plan follows common principles of utilitarianism, it still shows little or no regard for the individual human life. In World War Z, Redeker was publicly hated and ostracized, as that sort of plan seems outrageous when proposed in today’s society. However, days into the zombie outbreak, the South African government called in Paul Redeker to execute the plan - although the plan was heartless, it was a well-thought out and shockingly effective plan that saved the human race. In today’s reality, governments, intelligence agencies and authorities throughout history have demonstrated that short term loss of life is worth it for a long-term goal, and because of this it is not far-fetched to assume the government would abandon the majority of the population to ensure the survival of the elite.  If this were proposed today, the response would be almost all  is astonishing but a thought out simulation of a zombie outbreak (World War Z) shows us that faced with global catastrophe, our morals might be put on the back burner.

**Conclusion**
An inescapable consequence of the zombie apocalypse would be the death of countless human beings. As a result we consider the dissolution of society and the change in our morality - how does this mentality affect the long-term strategy that we use to endure the zombie outbreak? A common thread that we have explored is the notion of savagery and civility- we compared different groups of people, cannibals and zombies and placed them on the cline of savagery. The concept of civilisation has long been tied to society, norms, and delicate sensibilities, but maybe when faced with the task of rebuilding society we can really consider what it means to be civilised. 
Numerous examples of racism in history and in fictional zombie accounts suggest that fear and hate in society may be too deep rooted and intertwined to vanish. Perhaps civilisation is defined not by violence, ethics or how people treat one another, but simply by order. Anything above complete chaos can be called society - and that is what will be rebuilt after the zombie apocalypse.
