##Introduction

	Survival horror and the zombie genre entertain us, but they can also teach us about contemporary and historical social issues. Instances of zombie media such as _Get Out_, a 2017 film directed by Jordan Peele, _World War Z_, a 2006 novel written by Max Brooks, _Pontypool_, a 2008 movie directed by Bruce Mcdonald, and _Night of the Living Dead_, a movie released in 1968 directed by George Romero, take advantage of certain aspects of the zombie trope to discuss issues of racism, nationalism, and the thoughtless crowd mentality of humans such as ourselves. This paper will use Critical Discourse Analysis to contextually examine these zombie narratives as a means of exploring their societal critiques. Ultimately, we find that the zombie genre is particularly well-suited as a vehicle for these critical commentaries.

##Racial Issues in the U.S.

In 1860, the U.S. census registered almost four million slaves in the U.S. out of just over 4,440,000 Blacks. Until 1868, when it was overwritten by an amendment, it was constitutional law that slaves counted as only three fifths of a free person. This, in conjunction with the dominant worldview of the U.S. at the time, reduced Blacks to objects who could be stripped of their human rights and forced into slavery. Slavery was not seen as inhumane by the majority of White Americans at the time, at least not enough so as to warrant resistance to it, because Blacks were not viewed as human. These laws existed in the U.S. for well over a third of the its existence and were repealed only 150 years ago. 

Years after the Emancipation Proclamation, Black Americans were (and still are) being treated as less than White Americans and as less than human. Beginning in the mid-1950s, the Civil Rights Movement sought to end racial segregation and discrimination against Black Americans. The movement also fought for legal recognition and federal protection for Black Americans who often went unrecognized as full citizens. Although other chapters of the Black civil rights movements had occurred in the past, beginning in the 19th century, the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 60s utilized nonviolent protests and civil disobedience to address issues such as segregation, voting rights, and police brutality. This particular chapter of the movement ended with the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, but the fight to end racial discrimination in the United States continues today. 

##Racial Issues in the U.S.: _Night of the Living Dead_

George Romero’s classic horror film _Night of the Living Dead_ (1968) follows the struggle of seven people surviving the night in a farmhouse, as swarms of zombies invade their rural Pennsylvania town. Throughout the night, tensions rise between the occupants of the farmhouse, especially between Ben, the only Black person, and Harry. Eventually, everyone dies or succumbs to the zombies except for Ben, who survives the night only to be mistaken for a zombie and shot by a group of men led by the local sheriff. _Night of the Living Dead_ features distinct political commentary surrounding the racial divide and the treatment of Black Americans. The final scene of the film depicts Ben being shot by the group of White men and the sheriff, who are oddly casual and nonchalant about the entire zombie outbreak, which began no more than 24 hours before. They only see Ben from far away and do not hesitate to kill him even though it is not clear whether he is a zombie or not.

However, the most important part of the film’s ending is the continuing visual narrative played as background to the rolling credits, in which still images of the men disposing of Ben’s body are shown. The men first stand around Ben’s body and then drag him out of the house using meat hooks. This treatment of his body illustrates how the men see Ben as inhuman, a piece of meat to be disposed of. 

What is compelling about a zombie film addressing racial issues is the parallelism that is constructed between the Black man and the zombie. Ben’s treatment by the group of White men can be seen as overtly racist, but it can also be argued that their actions were not discriminatory towards Ben because he was Black, but because they thought him to be a zombie. The film’s end is interpretable and relatable to the political and civil climate of the 1960s and draws attention to the discrimination and violence against Black Americans.

##Racial Issues in the U.S.: _Get Out_

The 2017 mystery/thriller _Get Out_. directed by Jordan Peele, focuses on a young Black man, Chris, meeting his White girlfriend's family for the first time. Things become uncomfortable when her relatives begin to objectify Chris and talk about his “natural athleticism” and “how capable he’d be in a fight”. Then, a blind White man named Jim Hudson says:
“I want your eyes, man, I want those things you see through.”
Finally, it is revealed that Chris has been lured to the house in order to have his body stolen and given to the highest bidder in an auction. His brain will be removed, effectively killing him, and then the brain of a wealthy White man will be put into the host, making it possible for the buyer to use Chris’ body. However, Chris will not be entirely dead; some small part of him will be alive and able to experience everything that happens to his body, but he will be without any control. 

This state of disempowerment can be interpreted as an analogy for the experience of Blacks in the U.S, historically and currently. Throughout slavery and the existence of the Three Fifths Compromise in the U.S. Constitution, Blacks’ lives were similarly valued to the main Black characters in _Get Out_, whose bodies were being stolen. Slaves were able to see and experience everything that happened to them, but had very little control over their own lives. Emancipation gave Blacks more legal control over their own lives but systems of oppression continued to deny them self-sovereignty in many ways, from denying them voting rights to unjustly incarcerating them. _Get Out_ suggests that Blacks are still being forced to watch what happens to them from inside their own heads, with restricted control over their own lives. The unfortunate people who had already fallen victim to this surgical procedure, are effectively made into zombies. Their bodies are transformed into a walking corpse under the control of another person. _Get Out_ takes advantage of this acute subhumanity of the zombie trope to communicate the lived experience of Blacks and argue that Blacks continue to be seen and treated as subhuman.

##Nationalism and “Us versus Them” 

World War Two represented one of the first, and quite possibly the largest to date, total war situation in human history. The threat of death and destruction spread to almost every corner of the globe and very few areas went unaffected. The ubiquitous threat caused people to band together in newer stronger ways, and also caused new divisions between people. 

The constant threat of invasion and destruction created by the war instigated a banding together of peoples, often under a national flag, in order to survive the war. This nationalism caused countries to focus solely on the needs of their own people and disregard anyone of a different nation. Nations also began selectively excluding people within their own borders. In Germany, Jews were not included in the new national identity; in the U.S., Japanese-Americans were excluded and imprisoned within internment camps. Often the rights, sometimes even the lives of those excluded, were taken and this was justified as being for the good of those included in the nation.
