> We loved with a love that was more than love

##Introduction
	Survival horror and the zombie genre entertain us, but they can also teach us about contemporary and historical social issues. Instances of zombie media such as Get Out, a 2017 film directed by Jordan Peele, World War Z, a 2006 novel written by Max Brooks, Pontypool, a 2008 movie directed by Bruce Mcdonald, and Night of the Living Dead, a movie released in 1968 directed by George Romero, take advantage of certain aspects of the zombie trope to discuss issues of racism, nationalism, and the thoughtless crowd mentality of humans such as ourselves. This paper will use Critical Discourse Analysis to contextually examine these zombie narratives as a means of exploring their societal critiques. Ultimately, we find that the zombie genre is particularly well-suited as a vehicle for these critical commentaries.
