##Introduction

	Survival horror and the zombie genre entertain us, but they can also teach us about contemporary and historical social issues. Instances of zombie media such as _Get Out_, a 2017 film directed by Jordan Peele, _World War Z_, a 2006 novel written by Max Brooks, _Pontypool_, a 2008 movie directed by Bruce Mcdonald, and _Night of the Living Dead_, a movie released in 1968 directed by George Romero, take advantage of certain aspects of the zombie trope to discuss issues of racism, nationalism, and the thoughtless crowd mentality of humans such as ourselves. This paper will use Critical Discourse Analysis to contextually examine these zombie narratives as a means of exploring their societal critiques. Ultimately, we find that the zombie genre is particularly well-suited as a vehicle for these critical commentaries.

##Racial Issues in the U.S.

In 1860, the U.S. census registered almost four million slaves in the U.S. out of just over 4,440,000 Blacks[Gomez, Michael A. "Time and Space." Exchanging Our Country Marks: The Transformation of African Identities in the Colonial and Antebellum South. Chapel Hill, NC: U of North Carolina, 1998. 17-37. Print.][.] Until 1868, when it was overwritten by an amendment, it was constitutional law that slaves counted as only three fifths of a free person. This, in conjunction with the dominant worldview of the U.S. at the time, reduced Blacks to objects who could be stripped of their human rights and forced into slavery. Slavery was not seen as inhumane by the majority of White Americans at the time, at least not enough so as to warrant resistance to it, because Blacks were not viewed as human. These laws existed in the U.S. for well over a third of the its existence and were repealed only 150 years ago.
